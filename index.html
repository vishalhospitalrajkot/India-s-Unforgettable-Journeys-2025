    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style single-page application. The core is an interactive filter system allowing users to select travel themes (e.g., Heritage, Adventure, Spiritual, Nature). This dynamically updates a grid of destination cards. Clicking a card opens a modal with detailed information including descriptions and highlights. This structure was chosen over a linear report to empower users to explore content based on their personal interests, making the dense information more accessible and engaging. A summary chart provides a quick visual overview of the travel themes' prevalence across the top 20 destinations. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Full list of 20 destinations with extensive details. Goal: Organize & Explore. Viz/Presentation: Interactive card grid with dynamic filters and rich detail modals. Interaction: Users click filter buttons to narrow down destinations by type and "Learn More" on cards to access comprehensive details. Justification: This approach provides a highly digestible and interactive way to consume a large amount of information, facilitating user-driven exploration. The data now includes detailed paragraphs provided by the user. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation and state management.
        - Report Info: Primary appeal categories for all 20 destinations. Goal: Compare & Inform. Viz/Presentation: Horizontal Bar Chart. Interaction: Static visualization with tooltips on hover. Justification: The bar chart clearly visualizes the distribution of destination types, allowing for quick insights into India's diverse travel landscape. Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Specific key points and introduction. Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation: Integrated into the header and introductory sections. Justification: This ensures the user is immediately aware of the purpose and scope of the application. Library/Method: HTML text blocks.
